# sumcheck-on-G
This is a modified sumcheck protocol for multilinear polynomials with group coefficients.

The project mainly refers to the HyperPlonk developed by Espresso System. 

The fundamental multilinear polynomial interface is called from another repository https://github.com/FranklinZty/my-poly modified on ark-poly.
